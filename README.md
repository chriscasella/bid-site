OpenBid is an anonymous bid site for contractors searching for Request for Proposals (RFPs). The scope of OpenBid is to prevent bias or discrimination in the bid selection process. Users can sign up, create bids or auctions anonymously without ever exchanging information, until an auctioneer picks a winning bid. Then confirmation emails are sent to each party stating the contact information for both.
